let message = "hello world";

//myBirthday = "17-12-1999"; cannot assign to a constant variable, assignment can only be done once.

//UpperCase Constants

const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
console.log(color); // #FF7F00
//Being a “constant” just means that a variable’s value never changes. But some constants are known before execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and some constants are calculated in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.
